<p>My name is Rajagopalan A. I completed my master's in Manonmaniam Sundaranar University about Cyber security, I am passionate about software development and currently focusing on Java, Spring Boot, and full-stack web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along with backend development, I am also learning database management using PostgreSQL and automation testing with Selenium.</p>
<br><br>

<p>I actively practice data structures and algorithms on LeetCode and HackerRank to strengthen my problem-solving skills. I have also worked on several mini projects, such as a Student Record System, an IRCTC booking simulation, an HR Desk application, and a Food Delivery System, which helped me apply my programming knowledge to real-world scenarios.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I am also improving my Git/GitHub version control skills and focusing on writing clean, maintainable code. My goal is to become a Java Full Stack Developer and contribute to building scalable software solutions.</p>
